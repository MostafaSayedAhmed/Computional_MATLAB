# Description
Project consist of two part MATLAB Program and GUI MATLAB Program
## MATLAB Program 
MATLAB Program able to perform various computational mathmetics using various numerical methods : <br />
<ol>
  <li> Jacobi Method         : is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations. in this program it is able to solve 3 equation in 3 variables only.</li>
  <li> Bisection Method      : is used to evaluate zeroes of input function bonded by limit. Method is used to solve any equation in x. </li>
  <li> Newton-Raphson method : is a way to quickly find a good approximation for the root of a real-valued function. </li>
  <li> Trapezoidal method    : is used to calculate approxmiately value of definite integration. </li>
  <li> Simpson's 1/3 rule    : is used to find the approximate value of a definite integral. </li>
  <li> Euler's method        : is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value.</li>
  <li> Heun's method         : refer to the improved or modified Euler's method is a numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value.</li>
</ol>

## GUI MATLAB Program
GUI program designed using GUIDE tool in matlab and programmed using MATLAB Code used to perform function modelling from given set of point in x and y using the following models :
<ol>
  <li> Linear Regression Model : is a statistical model which estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. </li>
  <li> Exponential regression  : is used to model situations in which growth begins slowly and then accelerates rapidly without bound, or where decay begins rapidly and then slows down to get closer and closer to zero. </li>
  <li> Power Model             : is one in which the response variable is proportional to the explanatory variable raised to a power.</li>
  <li> Growth  Model           : is a statistical model that models the log-odds of an event as a linear combination of one or more independent variables.</li>
</ol>
